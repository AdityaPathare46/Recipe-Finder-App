Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/recipe-finder-app.git

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

This will open the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

üí° Usage
Upon opening the application, you'll see a default list of "chicken" recipes.

Use the search bar at the top to find recipes by typing a dish name (e.g., "pasta", "curry") or an ingredient (e.g., "cheese", "tomato").

Click on any recipe card to view its detailed ingredients and cooking instructions.

Click the 'X' button in the top right of the detailed view to return to the recipe list.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements
Favorites Feature: Allow users to save their favorite recipes (could use localStorage or a backend like Firebase Firestore).

Recipe Categories/Filters: Add options to filter recipes by category (e.g., "Dessert", "Breakfast") or cuisine (e.g., "Italian", "Indian").

Pagination: Implement pagination for search results if the API returns a large number of recipes.

More API Data: Integrate more details from TheMealDB API (e.g., YouTube links for video instructions).

User Authentication: If implementing a favorites feature with a backend, add user authentication.
